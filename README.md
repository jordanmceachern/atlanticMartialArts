# atlanticMartialArts-gatsby

Gatsby app that composes the atlantic martial arts web application.

To begin, in the root directory:

- Install node_modules by running "npm install".
- Run "npm run build-tw" to build tailwind styles.
- Run locally by with "npm run dev". * You may need to manually copy over the global.css file from the repo, in master's public directory.

To deploy to production:

- Run "npm run build-tw" to build tailwind styles.
- Run "npm run deploy" which will kick off a gatsby build and then deploy it to the production branch (gh-pages).

Notes:

- Node and Gatsby versions you are running can affect the ability the build, run, and deploy. Currently, be sure to use gatsby@5 and node@18.
- For HTTPS certification to be provided by Github, the "A" DNS providers with 4 associated IPs (e.g. 185.199.108.153 is for enabling Github's https) must be set as priority on the domain name provider's service.
- Production changes are currently set to be built from the public directory of the gh-pages branch.
- New deploys must be manually kicked-off on Github by un-publishing the previous build.
